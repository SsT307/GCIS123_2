/* ------------------------------ HASH ELEMENTS ----------------------------- */

Hashing: creating

Set = { }
    is dictionary without values, no keys
    Sets the values are the keys in dictionaries
    Sets have to have unique values


Dictionary = {key : value}
    has a key and value
    Dictionary has unique keys
    Dictionary time complexity: constant time - O(c)
    
Keys do not have to be numbers, can also be boolean values, and strings...


To access elements:
Printing: 
    print( dict_name[key] )

To access keys:
    print( dict_name.keys() )

To access a specific key that is a number:
    for i in dictionary_name.keys()
       if i == (keyNumber):
             print(dictionary_name[i]
       else:
