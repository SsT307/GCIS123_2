/* ------------------------------ HASH ELEMENTS ----------------------------- */

Hashing: transfering any data into the interger ( place in the ), used in disctionaries and sets to make sure '''''' are unique
for each unique input, a unique output
Sequence: can be a string, 

When keys are not unique:
Open Adressing: going to the next available address
Collision: taking another peice of memory with 2-3 elements for example, and have those elements where each key has its unique index

If there are duplicate values in a sequence that you are converting to set, it will only show one
Set = { }
    is dictionary without values, no keys
    Sets the values are the keys in dictionaries
    Sets have to have unique values


Dictionary = {key : value}
    has a key and value
    Dictionary has unique keys
    Dictionary time complexity: constant time - O(c)
    
Keys do not have to be numbers, can also be boolean values, and strings...

Set is immutable
Set cannot be accessed using indexes, you access them by iterating (loops)

To access elements:
Printing: 
    print( dict_name[key] )

To access keys:
    print( dict_name.keys() )

To access a specific key that is a number:
    for i in dictionary_name.keys()
       if i == (keyNumber):
             print(dictionary_name[i]
       else:
