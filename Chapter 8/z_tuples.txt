Tuples are immutable

Can store any type of value

List = []
Tuple = ()

Tuples have indexes
Tuple are immutable
If you print a tuple, it will print it out like it does with the array


tuple(value) = only one value, it splits each character and makes a tuple
list(value) = same thing ^^



append = adds values to the end
insert = adds values to the middle ("where you want to insert it", "what you want to insert")
