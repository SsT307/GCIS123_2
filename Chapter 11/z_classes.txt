Encapsulation: whatever is inside the __init__ --> self function, incapsulating all of the members and methods inside a class

Methods are also called:
    Behaviours

Members are also called:
    States
    Feild
    Attribute

An instance of a class is also called an object

A contructor is the __init__ function
    You can also use a specified constructor, which basically specifying defult memebers for whenever you call the function without parameters
    Self is with reference, you dont use them if you want to write defult specific memebers unless you want them to not be changed

Slots
    __slots__=[parameters]
    This will make sure that whatever the 'parameters' are, that they are the only ones used in the class
    Restricts the number of memebers
